"""The framework seam: let the pilot take turns the language model would have taken.

WHY A WRAPPER AND NOT A PATCH
-----------------------------
``_HarnessGameSession.play`` calls exactly one thing per turn
(``solver.py:333-342``)::

    result = self.analyzer.analyze(
        self.state_path, self.action_count,
        valid_actions=_engine_action_names(self.game),
        step_env=self.step_env, ...
    )

Every input the pilot needs is in that call - the runtime-state file holds the
current frame and the whole action history, ``valid_actions`` holds the buttons,
and ``step_env`` executes presses. So the entire integration is a decorator around
one method: no solver subclass, no monkeypatched internals, and if the pilot is
removed the call site is byte-identical to stock. That property is the point.
Every submission since 2.14 has scored below it, and two of them scored below it
because a *graft* changed behaviour that nobody had isolated.

:func:`arm` is how it gets there - one patch of ``HarnessSolver._make_analyzer``,
which is called once per game and hands over the ``game`` object. Note that the
object owning ``analyze`` is the *session*, not the solver (``solver.py:195-198``);
aiming at ``HarnessSolver.analyzer`` finds nothing.

WHAT IT COSTS THE PROMPT: NOTHING
---------------------------------
The measured lesson from the v14/v15 regression is that prose is not free - the run
is clock-bound, so a 10 KB addendum re-sent every turn is itself paid for in
actions, and the one addendum section that asked the model to batch its own actions
("One reply can carry several actions") was **inert**: v15's probe shows
``turns == actions`` on all four games, zero batching, while a different section of
the same addendum cost tn36 10.71 -> 4.89. This wrapper adds **zero tokens to the
prompt**. It does not ask the model to batch; it batches.

THE HANDBACK IS THE SAFETY PROPERTY
-----------------------------------
``Pilot.decide`` returns ``None`` whenever the learned model cannot stand behind a
move, and this wrapper then calls the real analyzer, unchanged. So the worst case
is stock behaviour plus a few microseconds of numpy, and the best case is a turn
that spends 40 actions instead of 1. There is no configuration in which the model
is prevented from playing.
